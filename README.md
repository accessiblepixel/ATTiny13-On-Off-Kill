# ATTiny13-On-Off-Kill

This is a port of the ATTiny85 On/Off/Kill sketch for the ATTiny13A, originally written by Ralph Bacon.

It needs the TinyCore from MCUDude (I think that's the one).

Connections are shown in the sketch, and I have finally added a schematic I put together last year but subsequently lost and found again today.
